/// A [std::collections::hash_map::RandomState] compatible hasher that initializes the [RapidHasher]
/// algorithm with a random seed and random global secrets.
///
/// This is designed to provide some HashDoS resistance by using a random seed per hashmap, and
/// a global random set of secrets.
///
/// # Portability
///
/// On most target platforms, the secrets are randomly initialized once and cached globally for the
/// lifetime of the program using a mix of ASLR and other entropy sources. The seed is randomly
/// initialized for each new instance of `RandomState` using only ASLR and a mixing step.
///
/// On targets without atomic pointer support, the global secrets will not be randomised, and
/// instead will fall back to the default secrets. This means these platforms will not have minimal
/// HashDoS resistance guarantees. If this is important for your application, please raise a GitHub
/// issue to improve support for these platforms.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
/// use std::hash::Hasher;
///
/// use rapidhash::quality::RandomState;
///
/// let mut map = HashMap::with_hasher(RandomState::default());
/// map.insert(42, "the answer");
/// ```
