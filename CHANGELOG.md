# Changelog

## 2.0.0 (20250723)

**Rapidhash algorithm changes** have pushed us towards a refactor of this crate. Compatibility with rapidhash V2.0, V2.1, V2.2, and V3 are now all supported under `rapidhash::v3` and `rapidhash::v2` modules. These expose `rapidhash_v3` and similar methods to avoid version confusion. Each version produces different hash outputs.

- **Breaking:** `RapidHasher` in-memory hasher overhaul:
  - `RapidHasher` deviates from the main rapidhash algorithm to improve performance hashing rust objects while maintaining similar hash quality. Performance should be significantly improved over the v1 crate.
  - `RapidHasher` may change the underlying hash between minor versions. The rust `Hasher` trait is not to be used for persistent hashing, and we will follow this mantra to allow easily improving hashing performance. Persistent hashing should be done though the `rapidhash::v3::rapidhash_v3(bytes: &[u8])` and equivalent functions.
  - `RapidHasher`, `RandomState`, `RapidHashMap`, and `RapidHashSet` now move behind the following three modules:
    - `rapidhash::fast` when hashing speed is the priority. This sacrifices some hash quality for speed, uses FNV when hashing integer types, and skips the final avalanche mixing step.
    - `rapidhash::quality` when hash quality is the ultimate priority. This closely resembles the rapidhash algorithm and hash quality.
    - `rapidhash::inner` when you want to configure the settings for `AVALANCHE`, `FNV`, `COMPACT`, and `PROTECTED` modes as necessary.
- **Breaking:** `rapidhash` persistent hashing function moved and renamed, with different hash output:
  - Fixed the rapidhash V1 algorithm for 48 and 144 length inputs, where it would previously mismatch with the C implementation.
    - If you need the old broken rapidhash V1 hash output, `rapidhash::v1::rapidhash_v1_inline` can accept a compile time argument `V1_BUG=true`, which will reproduce the old hash output from the 1.x crate versions.
  - Moved and renamed `rapidhash::rapidhash()` to `rapidhash::v1::rapidhash_v1()` to allow us to include other rapidhash versions in the same naming convention.
- **Breaking:** Random number generation has been moved behind the `rng` module, but otherwise works the same.
- **Breaking:** `RapidRandomState` has been renamed to `RandomState`, and moved into `fast`, `quality`, and `inner` modules.
- **Breaking:** Removed `rapid_mix` and `rapid_mum` from the public API for cleanliness. These are now internal functions.
- **Breaking:** Removed the `RapidInline*` variants in favour of making the default `Rapid` types inline by default. If this is a problem for your use case, please raise a GitHub issue, thanks!
- **Breaking:** Removed the deprecated `RapidHashBuilder` type, it has been replaced with `RapidBuildHasher` to match the rust naming convention.
- New: Added support for rapidhash V2.0, V2.1, V2.2, and V3 algorithms.
- New: rapidhash CLI now supports streaming properly with the V3 algorithm.
- Fix: Full tests and verification against the C implementations for all versions.
- Perf: Extensive benchmarking and optimisation, see more: https://github.com/hoxxep/rapidhash/issues/20

## 1.2.0 (20241204)

- Added rapidhash CLI via `cargo install rapidhash`.
- Docs typo fix.

## 1.1.0 (20241003)

- Added `RapidBuildHasher` to replace `RapidHashBuilder`.

## 1.0.0 (20241002)

Ownership kindly transferred by Justin Bradford to [Liam Gray](https://github.com/hoxxep) and this repository.

- **Breaking:** Removed the `hash` function that only hashes on `u128` types.
- Added `rapidhash` and `rapidhash_seeded` functions to hash byte streams.
- Added `RapidHasher` and `RapidHasherInline` for hashing via a `std::hash::Hasher` compatible interface.
- Added `RapidHashMap`, `RapidInlineHashMap`, `RapidHashSet`, and `RapidInlineHashSet` helper types.
- Added `RapidHashBuilder` and `RapidInlineHashBuilder` for `std::hash::BuildHasher` implementing types compatible with `HashMap` and `HashSet`.
- Added `RapidRandomState` for random seed initialisation.
- Added `RapidRng`, `rapidrng_fast`, and `rapidrng_time` for random number generation inspired by the [wyhash crate](https://docs.rs/wyhash/latest/wyhash/) but based on `rapid_mix`.
- Added `std`, `rand`, `rng`, and `unsafe` features.
- Extensive benchmarking and optimisation.

## 0.1.0

Initial release by [Justin Bradford](https://github.com/jabr) supporting rapidhash on `u128` inputs.

- Added `hash` for rapidhashing `u128` types.
